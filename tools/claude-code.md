# Claude Code

> AI-powered CLI for software engineering — code, debug, and ship from the terminal.

## What It Is

Claude Code is Anthropic's agentic coding tool that operates directly in the terminal. It understands entire codebases, edits files, runs commands, and handles multi-step engineering tasks autonomously. It works with any language, framework, or toolchain — no IDE plugins or configuration required.

## Why We Use It

Most AI coding assistants are bolted onto editors and limited to single-file suggestions. Claude Code operates at the project level — it reads across files, understands architecture, runs tests, and iterates on its own output. For a small team shipping fast, this collapses the feedback loop between thinking and working code. It handles the mechanical parts of engineering (boilerplate, refactoring, test writing, debugging) so we stay focused on design decisions and product direction.

## How We Use It

<!-- TODO: Document team-specific workflows — e.g., how you use it for PR reviews, feature scaffolding, debugging sessions, CLAUDE.md conventions, custom skills/hooks -->

## Getting Started

<!-- TODO: Add setup steps — installation, API key configuration, recommended settings, any team-specific CLAUDE.md files to pull -->
