# Obsidian

> Local-first, markdown-based knowledge management with AI-powered linking and retrieval.

## What It Is

Obsidian is a note-taking application built on plain markdown files stored locally. It features bidirectional linking, graph visualization of note relationships, and a plugin ecosystem that extends it into a full knowledge management system. With AI plugins like Smart Connections and Copilot, it becomes a tool where your notes are queryable and contextually connected.

## Why We Use It

Most note-taking tools lock your data in proprietary formats or require cloud sync to function. Obsidian keeps everything as local markdown files — portable, version-controllable, and fully owned. The linking system turns isolated notes into a connected knowledge graph, which compounds in value over time. For a team building with AI, having a structured local knowledge base also serves as high-quality context that can be fed into other tools. It bridges the gap between raw note-taking and an actual second brain.

## How We Use It

<!-- TODO: Document team-specific workflows — e.g., vault structure, shared templates, AI plugin configurations, how notes feed into other tools, meeting notes conventions -->

## Getting Started

<!-- TODO: Add setup steps — installation, recommended plugins, vault setup, any shared templates or configurations to import -->
