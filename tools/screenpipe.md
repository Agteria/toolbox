# Screenpipe

> 24/7 screen and audio capture with AI-powered search — a personal memory layer for your workstation.

## What It Is

Screenpipe continuously records your screen and audio, stores everything locally, and makes it searchable through AI. It runs as a background service, capturing OCR'd text from your screen and transcribed audio from meetings and conversations. You can query it in natural language to find anything you've seen or heard.

## Why We Use It

Knowledge work produces a constant stream of context that disappears — Slack threads you half-read, terminal output you scrolled past, meeting details you didn't write down. Screenpipe captures all of it passively. Instead of relying on memory or manually logging everything, we have a searchable record of our actual work. This is especially valuable for a distributed team where context gets lost between async conversations, calls, and deep work sessions.

## How We Use It

<!-- TODO: Document team-specific workflows — e.g., how you query past meetings, recover lost context, pipe data into other tools, any shared configurations or plugins -->

## Getting Started

<!-- TODO: Add setup steps — installation, privacy/storage configuration, recommended settings, any team conventions around what to capture -->
