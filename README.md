# Toolbox

AI tools and workflows powering productivity at Agteria.

---

We use AI-native tools across engineering, research, and operations. This repo documents what we use, why we chose it, and how we work with it — both as an internal reference and a window into how we build.

## Tools

| Tool | Category | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| [Claude Code](tools/claude-code.md) | Development | AI-powered CLI for software engineering |
| [Screenpipe](tools/screenpipe.md) | Capture & Search | Screen/audio capture with AI-powered search |
| [Obsidian](tools/obsidian.md) | Knowledge Management | AI-enhanced note-taking and knowledge base |
